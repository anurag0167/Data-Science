## Day 1: [NumPy](https://github.com/anurag0167/Data-Science/tree/main/Day1)

NumPy is a core library for numerical computing in Python. It provides powerful support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

### Topics Covered:
- Creating arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Array operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
- Broadcasting
- Aggregation functions (sum, mean, etc.)

### Official Documentation:
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

## Day 2: [Pandas](https://github.com/anurag0167/Data-Science/tree/main/Day2)

Pandas is an essential library for data manipulation and analysis, providing high-performance data structures like Series and DataFrame. Pandas is particularly useful for handling structured data such as spreadsheets, SQL databases, and CSV files.

### Topics Covered:
- DataFrame creation and manipulation
- Data selection and filtering
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, renaming columns, etc.)
- Grouping and aggregation
- Time series analysis
- Data visualization (basic plotting)

### Official Documentation:
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
